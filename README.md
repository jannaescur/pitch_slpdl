Three methods used for the Kaggle competition "Pitch estimation and voicing detection" of the subject Speech and Language Processing with Deep Learning (SLPDL) from ETSETB, UPC
These are three of the methods we tried for the competition. Other ones have been implemented, but with no good results. These three are the ones explained in the paper delivered. HSS method and Autocorrelation with preprocessing filters are the ones that have been submited at the end of the competition and that will be evaluated by the 70% left of the test data.
